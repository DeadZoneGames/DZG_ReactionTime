A Dead Zone Games Drag Racing Game

May 31st, 2020

On your mark! Get Set! GO!

Reaction Time is a single and multi-player car drag racing game. Hit shift points and gain a BURST
of speed to be the first to cross the finish line!



Goal: Achieve the highest score

Each game consists of 3 races.

Each race will be preceded with a countdown clock. When the clock reaches zero, the starting lights will
startup with a random delay. When the lights turn green, press the spacebar to GO!

In order to obtain optimum speed and points during a race, players will need to execute perfect shifts.
Shifting will be done by pressing the spacebar when the red “gear shift” indicator reaches a yellow shift marker.
Pressing the spacebar before or after this perfect shift point will result in a reduction of points.

At the end of each game, the player’s final score will be displayed.

For multiplayer games, the player with the highest score wins.
